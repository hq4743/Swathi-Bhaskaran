# E-commerce Analytics Portfolio Project

This repository hosts my portfolio site (GitHub Pages) and an end‑to‑end e‑commerce analysis built around a 20K+ row dataset. The outline follows the AnalyticsAccelerator template: [AnalyticsAccelerator/sample_repo](https://github.com/AnalyticsAccelerator/sample_repo).

## Project Background

A mid‑market online retailer operating across US, CA, UK, DE, FR, AU, and IN seeks to understand growth and retention. The business sells in 8 categories through Organic, Social, Email, Direct, Paid Ads, and Affiliate channels. Key metrics: revenue, transactions, AOV, segment mix, and category contribution.

Focus areas:
- **Sales performance** (quarterly revenue and transactions)
- **Customer dynamics** (behavior‑based segmentation using purchase recency, frequency, and spend patterns), CLV signals, and churn risk
- **Product portfolio** (category mix, 80/20 effects)
- **Channel mix** (acquisition effectiveness)

Dataset: `assets/cleaned_data.csv` (generated by `generate_ecommerce_csv.py`).

## Data Structure & Initial Checks

Single wide fact table (~20,847 rows, 18 columns):
- order details: `order_id`, `order_date`, `order_status`, `days_to_ship`, `returned`
- customer: `customer_id`, `customer_segment` (High‑Value, Frequent, Seasonal, Price‑Sensitive, New, At‑Risk), `country`
- product: `product_id`, `category`, `sub_category`
- economics: `unit_price`, `quantity`, `discount`, `shipping_cost`, `revenue`
- channel & payment: `channel`, `payment_method`

QA highlights:
- Dates 2023‑01‑01 → 2024‑12‑31; no duplicate `order_id`
- Revenue ≥ 0 after discounts; shipping cost within 0–35
- Returns ≈ 5%; quantity ∈ {1..5}

## Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings
- **Seasonality**: Q4 revenue outperforms Q1 by ~52% with consistent transaction growth.
- **80/20**: ~20% SKUs generate ~78% revenue; invest in top sellers and bundles.
- **Retention**: High‑Value and Frequent cohorts drive CLV; At‑Risk and Price‑Sensitive need targeted offers.

Interactive charts are available in the portfolio modal (no new tab): Sales, Customers, Products.

## Insights Deep Dive

### Sales
- Rising revenue trajectory; Q4 seasonal lift confirmed by transactions (K).
- AOV steady; targeted discounts avoid margin erosion.
- Faster shipping (low `days_to_ship`) improves conversion for Price‑Sensitive.

### Customers
- 6‑segment view derived from purchase recency, frequency, and monetary patterns (no ML):
  - High‑Value + Frequent = outsized contribution and repeat cadence
  - Seasonal peaks in Q4 → start promos late Q3
  - At‑Risk responds to re‑activation with capped discounts

### Products
- Category revenue distribution led by Electronics and Fashion; Home & Garden, Sports are resilient middle.
- Long‑tail items benefit from bundles and onsite discoverability.

### Channels
- Organic leads; Email sustains existing cohorts; Paid Ads for acquisition with ROAS guardrails.

## Recommendations
- **Holiday playbook**: Pull forward Q4 offers, tier discounts; monitor margin.
- **Retention**: CLV‑based incentives for At‑Risk; keep SLA ≤ 2–3 days for price‑sensitive shoppers.
- **Merchandising**: Prioritize availability/content for top 20% SKUs; bundle long‑tail.
- **Channel mix**: Maintain Organic/Email; tighten Paid Ads CAC with category‑level targets.

## Assumptions and Caveats
- Synthetic, programmatically generated dataset; realistic but not production data.
- Returns rate and payment mix are simplified.
- Segment/category shares calibrated, not modeled from historicals.

## How to Run Locally

1. Open `temp_portfolio/index.html` in a browser (or any static server).
2. Ensure `assets/cleaned_data.csv` exists.
   - Generate with: `python generate_ecommerce_csv.py` → writes to `assets/cleaned_data.csv`.
3. Click “View Analysis” on the E‑commerce card; use tabs for Sales/Customers/Products/Data.

Charts are fixed at 640×180 for consistent in‑modal rendering. The Data tab paginates the CSV.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

- Repo root: upload `index.html`, `ind.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`
- In `assets/`: `profile.png`, `swathi_resume.pdf`, `cleaned_data.csv`
- Settings → Pages → Source: `main` / `(root)`
- Wait 2–5 minutes → open `https://hq4743.github.io/?v=21`

## File Guide

- `index.html`, `ind.html` — portfolio pages
- `style.css` — theming, modal and chart container layout
- `script.js` — modal tabs, Chart.js configs, CSV loader with cache‑buster
- `generate_ecommerce_csv.py` — dataset generator (~20K rows)
- `assets/cleaned_data.csv` — analysis dataset
- `assets/swathi_resume.pdf` — embedded resume
